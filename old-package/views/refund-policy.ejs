        <h1>Refund Policy</h1>

        <h2>Authenticity Guarantee</h2>
        <p>At whitewolfindia.com, we ONLY stock authentic products. All our items are genuine and are sourced directly from the manufacturer or from their authorized distributors. Prior to shipping, we do several levels of rigorous quality checks, hence eliminating any chances of counterfeit products. If you have any concerns about the authenticity of any of the items you have purchased from us or are considering purchasing, please contact us directly by emailing us at <a href="mailto:care@whitewolfindia.com">care@whitewolfindia.com</a>, and we shall be happy to address your concerns.</p>

        <h2>Returns Policy</h2>
        <p>Kushmanda Cosmetics offers its customers an 'Easy return policy,' wherein you can raise a return/exchange request of a product within 7 days of its delivery. We also accept partial returns wherein you can raise a return request for one or all products in your order.</p>

        <h4>Step 1: Contact our Customer Support team</h4>
        <p>Contact our Customer Support team via email (<a href="mailto:care@whitewolfindia.com">care@whitewolfindia.com</a>) within 7 business days of receiving the order. You can also visit your order page to initiate returns.</p>

        <h4>Step 2: Provide order ID details</h4>
        <p>Provide us with your order ID details and your request to return/replace/refund your order. Kindly email an image & video of the product and the invoice for our reference.</p>

        <h4>Step 3: Product pickup</h4>
        <p>We will pick up the products within 2-4 business days. We will initiate the refund or replacement process only if the products are received by us in their original packaging with their seals, labels, and barcodes intact.</p>

        <p>Special instructions for reverse pickup: The reverse product will be assigned within 24-48 hours, and the product will be picked in another 4-5 working days. After the product is picked along with the packaging box, we will initiate a refund after carefully examining it.</p>

        <p>Note: If it is a case of replacement, it is subject to the availability of stock. In case that a replacement may not be available, we will refund you the full amount. The free gift is included as a part of the item order and needs to be returned along with the originally delivered product.</p>

        <p>In case of one or more defective products in your order, please register a single complaint as the return/replacement will be arranged only once. A return can be created at the item level, and if you have ordered multiple items, you can initiate a return/replacement/refund for any individual item. However, any product being returned needs to be returned in full including all components as well as any complimentary gifts or products which came along with it.</p>

        <h4>Returns will not be accepted under the following conditions:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Product is damaged due to misuse/overuse</li>
            <li>Returned without original packaging including, price tags, labels, original packing, freebies, and other accessories or if original packaging is damaged</li>
            <li>Serial Number is tampered</li>
            <li>Defective products that are not covered under Seller/Manufacturer’s warranty</li>
            <li>Product is used or altered</li>
            <li>If the request is initiated after 7 business days of order delivery</li>
            <li>Free product provided by the brand</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Refunds Policy</h2>
        <p>Refunds are processed in a maximum of 15 days from the date on which Kushmanda Cosmetics receives returned goods. In case of a prepaid order through Credit Card, Debit Card, or Net Banking, the amount will be refunded back to the account from which it was paid within 3-5 working days.</p>

        <p>In case of cash on delivery orders, we will initiate a bank transfer against the refund amount against the billing details shared by you or via UPI transfer. This process will be completed within 24-48 business hours of us receiving the products back and your bank details on email. It will take an additional 2-3 business days for the amount to reflect in your account.</p>

        <p>Please note that Cash-on-Delivery charges and Shipping Charges (if applicable) are not refundable. Products included in the Kit/Set/Combos are not eligible for returns or replacement.</p>

        <h2>Cancellation Policy</h2>
        <p>An order can be cancelled only if it has not been shipped yet. You will have to send us an email on <a href="mailto:care@whitewolfindia.com">care@whitewolfindia.com</a> with reasons for the cancellation or call us on 180021020016 (Mon - Sat: 10 am to 6 PM), and we will help you in cancelling the order.</p>

        <p>Once you request the cancellation of item(s) in your order, it will take us a maximum of 1-2 business days to cancel the order. You will be notified of the same by email. In such cases, the order will be cancelled, and the money will be refunded to you within 24-48 business hours after the cancellation request is duly processed by us.</p>
